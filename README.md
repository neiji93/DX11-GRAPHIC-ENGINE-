Several textures handling except ior value, transmission and
Emission. Can add overrided textures, perceptual textures,
Computed textures, indirect lighting textures and files.
Can push forward for artists handling (like calling some 
Functions multiple times). I'm not sure for direct illumination
artistic point of view creating technical artists hands-on techniques
but you can add texture similairties handling function/nodes if you
want to extend this engine severely. If Im' not wrong, ogre 3D graphics
can be used if you take only emission texture source code. The rest have
no interest for me.
Please email me as it is an ambitious project.
Notice that almost all my softwares can be used together perfectly.
